        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>We’re looking for a curious Software Developer Intern to help us build internal tools that empower multiple product teams across the company. You’ll contribute to UI components, APIs, data pipelines, and internal dashboards that improve developer velocity and product quality. You’ll pair with mentors, participate in code reviews, and learn how modern software gets planned, shipped, and maintained.</p>
        <p>During the internship you’ll own at least one end-to-end project: discovery, design review, a minimal viable slice, iterative improvements, and a measurable outcome. You’ll learn to write clean code, ship small, and use feature flags, experiments, and observability to validate ideas. You’ll also learn good git hygiene, CI/CD, and how to communicate trade-offs.</p>
        <p>We work in a pragmatic stack with strong testing and automation. You won’t be stuck doing “intern work”—you’ll deliver code that other teams actually use, with real users and production traffic. Expect supportive feedback, clear goals, and lots of opportunities to demo your progress.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-16">What you’ll do</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Build features for internal web tools used daily by engineers, designers, and operations.</li>
          <li>Contribute to REST/JSON endpoints and small services that integrate with existing systems.</li>
          <li>Add telemetry (logs/metrics/traces) so features are observable and debuggable in prod.</li>
          <li>Write unit and integration tests; help add missing tests to legacy paths.</li>
          <li>Participate in design and architecture reviews; ask great questions and propose options.</li>
          <li>Document decisions, APIs, and runbooks so others can operate what we build.</li>
          <li>Collaborate with PM and Design on scope, edge cases, and user acceptance criteria.</li>
          <li>Demo completed work; iterate based on feedback and real-world usage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-16">Minimum requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React knowledge is a plus).</li>
          <li>Comfortable with at least one backend language (Python/Node/Java/Go/Ruby all fine).</li>
          <li>Git fundamentals: branching, pull requests, reviews, resolving merge conflicts.</li>
          <li>Familiarity with HTTP/REST, JSON, and browser devtools.</li>
          <li>Clear written communication; willingness to ask for help early.</li>
          <li>Growth mindset and an interest in product-focused engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-16">Nice to have</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Experience with React + TypeScript or another typed front-end setup.</li>
          <li>Basic SQL skills (reading/writing queries, joins, indexes at a high level).</li>
          <li>Exposure to Docker and containerized local development.</li>
          <li>Understanding of testing pyramid and mocking vs. integration trade-offs.</li>
          <li>Some knowledge of accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav, color contrast).</li>
          <li>Interest in developer tooling, build pipelines, or platform engineering.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-16">Benefits of the internship</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mentorship from senior engineers with weekly 1:1s and code-review guidance.</li>
          <li>Flexible hours and remote-friendly collaboration practices.</li>
          <li>Intern learning series (tech talks, product deep dives, career panels).</li>
          <li>Opportunity to ship features used by hundreds of teammates.</li>
          <li>Clear conversion paths for future internships and return offers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You don’t need to meet every single bullet to apply—if you’re excited about building tools and learning fast, we want to hear from you.</p>
